<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setting up SQL database</h3>
<p>The SQL was written for MySQL. To set up the database from PHPMyAdmin, goto PHPMyAdmin, click on the 'SQL' tab, and paste in the contents of the file and press go in the bottom right-hand corner.</p>

<p>To enter the SQL information, goto src/Constants and change the information:</p>

<pre><code>define("DB_HOST","localhost");
define("DB_NAME","mike");
define("DB_USER","root");
define("DB_PASSWORD","");
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="Walk-Through" class="anchor" href="#Walk-Through" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Walk Through</h3>
<p>The website is written with PHP classes. There are two main classes: Player and Team.</p>

<pre><code>private $teamId;
private $teamName;
private $teamPoints;
private $teamLeader;
private $teamStatus;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>private $playerId;
private $playerName;
private $playerEmail;
private $playerPassword;
private $teamId;
private $playerStatus;
private $groupId;
</code></pre>

<p>To create an instance of a class, do the following:</p>

<pre><code>$player = new Player($playerId, $playerName, $playerEmail, $teamId, $playerStatus, $groupId);
</code></pre>

<p>To get information from the class, you must call a getter. To do this do:</p>

<pre><code>$player->getPlayerId();
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Some getters may not be there as I haven't needed them. Just copy / paste an existing one if you find yourself needing one.</p>

<p>There is almost no need to create a player or team instance manually. You can just call <code>$db->loadPlayer($playerId)</code> or <code>$db->loadTeam($teamId)</code> and it will return an instance ready to use.</p>

<pre><code>$db = new Database();
$player = $db->loadPlayer($playerId);
</code></pre>

<p>There are a lot of functions in the Database class. Most could be removed and probably will be. Right now every function is being used somewhere but I am going to remove functions that don't need to be there and can be done using the loadPlayer or loadTeam.</p>

<p>All HTML is inside the Html class. Please do not place any HTML inside of any other classes.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a page that displays the header, footer and displays a simple message:</p>

<pre><code>&#60;?PHP

include './src/Constants.php';
include './autoloader.php';

$html = new Html("Simple Message");

$html->printHeader();

echo "Hello, how are you!";

$html->printFooter();
</code></pre>

<p>The autoloader is a class that automatically loads a class when you use it. Without this, you would have to include every php class file every time. The literal passed into the HTML class is what the title of the HTML page will be set to.</p>

<h3>
<a id="Naming-Conventions" class="anchor" href="#Naming-Conventions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Naming Conventions</h3>
<p>PHP files that output HTML should be lowercase with underscores for spaces. PHP files that are used as scripts should be camel casing. PHP varibles should be camel casing. SQL names should be lowercase with underscores for spaces. PHP classes should start with an uppercase and be camel casing. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code>$thisIsANumber
deleteAllUsers.php
view_all_users.php
MySuperCoolClass.php
player_coolness (SQL name)
</code></pre>

<!--<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
