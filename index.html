<a id="setting-up-sql-database" class="anchor" href="#setting-up-sql-database" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setting up SQL database</h3>

<p>The SQL was written for MySQL. To set up the database from PHPMyAdmin, goto PHPMyAdmin, click on the 'SQL' tab, and paste in the contents of the file and press go in the bottom right-hand corner.</p>

<p>To enter the SQL information, goto src/Constants and change the information:</p>

<pre><code>define("DB_HOST","localhost");
define("DB_NAME","mike");
define("DB_USER","root");
define("DB_PASSWORD","");
</code></pre>

<a id="walk-through" class="anchor" href="#walk-through" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Walk Through</h3>

<p>The website is written with PHP classes. There are two main classes: Player and Team.</p>

<pre><code>private $teamId;
private $teamName;
private $teamPoints;
private $teamLeader;
private $teamStatus;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>private $playerId;
private $playerName;
private $playerEmail;
private $playerPassword;
private $teamId;
private $playerStatus;
private $groupId;
</code></pre>

<p>To create an instance of a class, do the following:</p>

<pre><code>$player = new Player($playerId, $playerName, $playerEmail, $teamId, $playerStatus, $groupId);v
</code></pre>

<p>To get information from the class, you must call a getter. To do this do:</p>

<pre><code>$player-&gt;getPlayerId();
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Some getters may not be there as I haven't needed them. Just copy / paste an existing one if you find yourself needing one.</p>

<p>There is almost no need to create a player or team instance manually. You can just call <code>$db-&gt;loadPlayer($playerId)</code> or <code>$db-&gt;loadTeam($teamId)</code> and it will return an instance ready to use.</p>

<pre><code>$db = new Database();
$player = $db-&gt;loadPlayer($playerId);
</code></pre>

<p>There are a lot of functions in the Database class. Most could be removed and probably will be. Right now every function is being used somewhere but I am going to remove functions that don't need to be there and can be done using the loadPlayer or loadTeam.</p>

<p>All HTML is inside the Html class. Please do not place any HTML inside of any other classes.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a page that displays the header, footer and displays a simple message:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?PHP

include './src/Constants.php';
include './autoloader.php';

$html = new Html("Simple Message");

$html-&gt;printHeader();

echo "Hello, how are you!";

$html-&gt;printFooter();
</code></pre>

<p>The autoloader is a class that automatically loads a class when you use it. Without this, you would have to include every php class file every time. The literal passed into the HTML class is what the title of the HTML page will be set to.</p>

<p>Only two things are stored in SESSION: playerName and playerId.</p>

<h3>
<a id="naming-conventions" class="anchor" href="#naming-conventions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Naming Conventions</h3>

<p>PHP files that output HTML should be lowercase with underscores for spaces. PHP files that are used as scripts should be camel casing. PHP varibles should be camel casing. SQL names should be lowercase with underscores for spaces. PHP classes should start with an uppercase and be camel casing. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code>$thisIsANumber
deleteAllUsers.php
view_all_users.php
MySuperCoolClass.php
player_coolness (SQL name)
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="plans" class="anchor" href="#plans" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plans</h3>

<p>Currently, I am not too sure where this project will go. Right now I am going to be concentrating on points. Displaying them, adding them, etc. One thing I do have on my mind to add is md5 sum checking when submitting a form to stop remote site injection.</p>
